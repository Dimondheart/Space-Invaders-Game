## Features ##

### Current Features ###
- Framework
- Partial game states (main menu, level, quit)
- Partial entities (Barriers, Player)
- Barriers
- Player ship
- Movement
- Player control
- Basic weapon & bullets
- Health
- And a few more things...

### Planned Features ###
- All normal space invaders features
- Shiny, scale-able vector-based graphics

At some point in the future, after I have finished implementing the basic Space Invaders features, I may add my own features to this (see below for some possibilities).

### Possible Features/Ideas ###
- A defense game mode, with multiple different "battle zones" that you can warp between.  If any enemies hit the lower edge of any battle zone, it is game over.
- Multiplayer option (both classic and, if added, the defense/coop game mode mentioned above)
- A special weapon with a longer recharge time that allows you to shoot sideways (gives you more chance to win and hopefully would make it more fun and less "OMG I let one  or two enemies get too far down I'm doomed!!!", and also some other possibilities for things like suicide bomber enemies that come in from the side)
- Tough motherships that dispense smaller enemies until destroyed
